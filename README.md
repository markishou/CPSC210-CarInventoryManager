# Used Car Inventory

## Project description

**The Functionality:**

This application is a used car inventory that showcases pre-existing vehicles that have been listed. The user can also
add additional vehicles to the inventory if needed. Additionally, this app will allow the user to search for a vehicle 
listed in the inventory which will then return cars based on the user's interests. 

**The Features:**
- Search and return function that gives the use a list of cars based on their specifications.
- Listings must specify whether a car is stock or modified.
- Input a range of years instead of a single year to return cars of a specific "generation".

**The Audience:**

This app is for people who are in the market to buy a used vehicle. However, **it is aimed 
towards individuals that want to buy used cars for the purpose of modifying or building them.** 

**The Why:**

Currently, many of the popular marketplaces (e.g. craigslist, facebook marketplace) for used cars take away from the 
experience of users who want to buy them for the purpose of modifying and making it their own. This is true as these 
marketplaces throw unnecessary listings when you search for a specific model of a car, making the process more 
time-consuming and difficult. That being said, this project is of interest to me as I want to create the optimal
experience for individuals looking for their next car to work on.
